# Section 8 Challenge #

Write a program that asks the user to enter the following:
An integer representing the number of cents

You may assume that the number of cents entered is greater than or equal to zero

The program should then display how to provide that change to the user.


-	1 dollar 	= 		100 cents
-	1 quarter 	=		25 cents
-	1 dime		=		10 cents
-	1 nickel	=		5 cents, and
-	1 penny		= 		1 cent

Sample run:

Enter an amount in cents: 92

You can provide the change as follows:
-	dollars 	= 	0
-	quarter		= 	3
-	dimes 		=	1
- 	nickels		= 	1
- 	pennies		=	1

Solve the problem both with and without modulo operator
