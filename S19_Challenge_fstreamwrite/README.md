# Section 19 Challenge 4 - Copy file with line numbers #

This challenge could be pretty easy.
The text to Romeo and Juliet is provided in a file named romeoandjuliet.txt.

For this challenge you have to make a copy of the Romeo and Juliet file and save it to another file. 
This new copy should have line numbers at the beginning of each line in the play.
Please format the numbers nicely so everything lines up.

Feel free to extend this challenge in any way you like.
For example, you may want to provide line numbers only for lines that actually have text.

Have fun!
